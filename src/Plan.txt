Plan:

- Piece parent class. Each piece has method called computeMoves
- BoardStateManager is for setting up board, checking for location of pieces (when determining validity),
	checking for mate, maybe also checks, value of board
- Negamax class

- At first glance, each piece has unit directions and can either move once in that direction or multiple times.
	The exceptions seem to be castling, pawns (2 move from starting row)

- BM will have to initialize all Piece Move Generators
